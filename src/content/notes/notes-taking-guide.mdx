We've been moving toward a "post-literate society" for a while now(TV, then social media). 
We started getting information in quick, easy, and digestible chunks. AI is making this worse. 
Why read a whole article when AI can summarize it for you? Why work 
through a hard problem when AI can solve it? 

I believe that self-governing communities need thoughtful citizens. 
We need knowledge workers and college graduates who can interpret the context within articles/academic papers.
Citizens who can tell truth from lies. Citizens who can process complex information and make good decisions.

I made a guide to help people take better notes, because good notes do more than just save information; 
good notes are thinking toolsðŸ§ 

> Use this **[guide](https://taking-notes-six.vercel.app/)** to take notes that actually help you build knowledge systems that
> grow over time. Learn to digest information instead of just consuming it & most importantly, think critically 
> about what you get from the world especially from the digital web.
