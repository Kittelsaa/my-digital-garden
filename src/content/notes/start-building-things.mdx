If you are creative person, 99% of the time you are not sad, you just need to create. 
The most insufferable people are creative people who don't have an outlet, I deeply relate to this and whether you work on creative 
projects or design â€” the principle remains the same: create or suffer.

Avoid creative dead zones where your energy stagnates. Your unused creative force transforms into anxiety, obsession over trivial 
matters, and depression. Channel the creative force instead.
Create, learn from the terrible projects, and release the shame. 
Embrace creative failure. Your good work really exists on the other side of your fear.
