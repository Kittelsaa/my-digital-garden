Obsidian works really well for my note-taking needs, but what's perfect for me might not be perfect for you. Everyone 
has different ways of thinking and organizing, so I'd encourage exploring other **[apps](https://taking-notes-six.vercel.app/posts/notes-taking-tool)** to find what fits your style.

Considering that I've tried nearly every note-taking app out there, here are different reasons why Obsidian 
works for me as a Software Engineer:
- Obsidian is stores notes as plain text markdown. I'm not sure if obsidian may eventually go away but my data is stored on my computer in plain text. Will Dropbox, 
Google Drive, and iCloud all exist in 10 years I'm not sure but I still have the data in plain text so I can edit 
and read it with any text editor. I want my notes to be able to move from program to program without dependency on any program or the device I am using.
- Obsidian is offline first means that the data is stored on your computer or phone
- The app currently has 2,527 plugins in the built-in plugin installer and you may easily create your own, 
plugins are written in JavaScript and can change any part of the system 
- It's fast and reliable compared to Notion, Google Notes, etc.
- Obsidian has a customizable interface, you can customize the app to your preferences. I don't do this 
regularly because it can be waste of time when you focus too hard on customizing that you forget to take notes.
- I also need my tool to be free/non-commercial/open-source - this is more philosophical, many tech pioneers, 
open-source projects have helped others build even better systems and greedy late stage capitalism won't make me 
forget about these important roots
