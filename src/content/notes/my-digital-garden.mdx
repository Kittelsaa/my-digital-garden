I have gotten used to the term 'digital gardening' to describe my notes taking 
process because gardening is not just writing notes, but actively 
finding links between different pieces of knowledge. 

A "digital garden" is an analogy/framework used to take more [intentional notes](https://taking-notes-six.vercel.app/).
I have really enjoyed using this system to build my own personal private digital garden using [obsidian](/notes/obsidian-tool), but I'm taking a step further by gardening in public, sharing some of my notes & ideas in public, 
which is a core principles of digital gardening. 
You can access and use the repository of this project [here](https://github.com/Kittelsaa/my-digital-garden) to build your own digital garden.
